<h3>The Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup unsweetened dried cranberries</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1/2 Tbsp honey</li>
    <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
    <li>4 large sweet potatoes</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped kale, packed</li>
    <li>1/2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup pepitas</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, add the cranberries, apple cider vinegar, honey, and the juice of the lemon. Microwave for 1 minute. Let the cranberries steep while you prepare the sweet potatoes.</li>
    <li>Rinse the sweet potatoes well. Pierce the surface of the potatoes a few times with a fork and then microwave for 10 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through. They are done when a fork can easily pierce through them. The cooking time will vary depending on your microwave's strength and size of the potatoes.</li>
    <li>In the meantime, use a fork to smash the rehydrated cranberries to help thicken their sauce.</li>
    <li>Add the kale to a large bowl along with the olive oil and salt. Massage the kale for about 30 seconds until tender. Mix the pepitas and the un-drained cranberries into the kale.</li>
    <li>Once the potatoes are done, slice the potatoes in half (but not all the way through) and fluff the insides with a fork. </li>
    <li>Divide the kale between the four potatoes. Finish with a sprinkle of lemon zest on each potato.</li>
</ol>
